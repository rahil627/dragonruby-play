  # but the real trap is ||= true which will always overwrite the value with true not only the first time 
  # since a ||= b is just  a = (a || b), actually a || (a = b) (slightly different) which in case of true will never end well ðŸ˜›  because false || true will always be true ðŸ˜›

# hashes and arrays
Array is one of the most powerful classes in Ruby and a very fundamental component of Game Toolkit.

A Hash has certain similarities to an Array, but:
An Array index is always an Integer.
A Hash key can be (almost) any object.

An Array is an ordered, integer-indexed collection of objects, called elements. Any object (even another array) may be an array element, and an array can contain objects of different types.


**hash
*array
  # These are splat operators, they'll deconstruct your hash/array into arguments for a method. 

# destructure
array = [10, 20]
x, y = array # destructuring here is position based

# using spread (reverse splat?) for remaining
player = [5, 5, "Player 1", 5, 5] # x, y, name, w, h
player_x, player_y, name, *player_size = player # 5, 5, Player 1, [5, 5]

# splat operator

## for args
target = { x: 50, y: 50 }
def move_to(x:, y:)
  # moves player to x, y
end
move_to(**target)
  # hash splat

target = [50, 50]
def move_to(x, y)
  # moves player to x, y
end
move_to(*target)
  # array splat

old_hash = { a: 1, b: 2 }
hash = { a: 5, **old_hash, b: 6 } # => { a: 1, b: 6 }
  # args replaced by order of precedence

old_array = [2, 3, 4 , 5]
array = [ 1, 2, *old_array, 5, 6] # => [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]
  # not for arrays tho..

"hashsplat is useful for moments when ~'a lot of the things i want to output are similar'"



enemies = [{ type: "goomba", alive: true }, { type: "koopa", alive: true }, { type: "goomba", alive: false }, { type: "koopa", alive: true }]
alive_enemies, dead_enemies = enemies.partition(&:alive) # splits into alive group and the rest



## hashes
screen ||= {0, 0, 720, 1280} # error
screen ||= {x: 0, y: 0, h: 720, w: 1280} # hashes need keys


## arrays





  

# from getting started tutorial
   
args.outputs.labels << [580, 400, 'Hello World!']
  # The "<<" thing says "append this array onto the list of them at args.outputs.labels)
  
args.state.rotation ||= 0
  # shorthand for "if args.state.rotation isn't initialized, set it to zero." It's a nice way to embed your initialization code right next to where you need the variable.
  #  - amazing..!

args.state.laser.trash ||= true
  # nested field mades on-the-fly..?



# loops
# loops are quite different..
array = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
array.each do |char|
  puts char
end  

array.each do |char, i|
  puts "index #{i}: #{char}"
end

3.times do |i|
  puts i
end

(0...4).each do |i|
  puts i
end
  # range block exclusive (three dots), excluding last number
  # 0-3, 4 matches the number of elements in an array

(0..3).each do |i|
  puts i
end
  # range block inclusive (two dots), including last number
  # 0-3
