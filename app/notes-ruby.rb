Array is one of the most powerful classes in Ruby and a very fundamental component of Game Toolkit.

  
args.outputs.labels << [580, 400, 'Hello World!']
  # The "<<" thing says "append this array onto the list of them at args.outputs.labels)
  
args.state.rotation ||= 0
  # shorthand for "if args.state.rotation isn't initialized, set it to zero." It's a nice way to embed your initialization code right next to where you need the variable.
  #  - amazing..!
